# Family Car Selector 

## This is a simple JavaScript function that recommends a car based on:
- Family size
- Planned driving distance

### Logic:
- If family size ≤ 4 and distance < 200 → Tesla
- If family size ≤ 4 and distance ≥ 200 → Toyota Camry
- If family size > 4 → Minivan

### Output:
Uses `console.log()` to display the recommended car.

### Purpose:
Great for QA testers learning conditional logic and return statements.
